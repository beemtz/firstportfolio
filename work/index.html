           <p>Everything you see here is fully customizable. Images can be your own or stock ones. There's no limit to the beauty of Google Fonts, although I wouldn't use more than two, <EM>maybe</EM> three. And you can have as many extra sections or columns as you want. Same goes for adding as many content pages as you need.</p>
           <p>Please note these, as my own website, are static designs. Meaning I will have to learn a bit more to make them look perfect on a mobile device. After all, this is not a sales pitch, I'm only showing the current state of my skills.</p>

           <h2>Personal Style Website</h2>

           <p>This was my first HTML+CSS excersice and it's the basis of the website you're visiting right now. Since I had so much questions and subsequent guidance while doing it, I know it pretty well. </p>

           <p>My favorite thing while coding this was practicing how to add images using CSS instead of HTML, which allows for text to be superimposed on the pictures.</p>

          <p>I'd recommed something like this if you want a neat, easy to read website with minor navigation, and a professional look.</p>

                 <h2>Commerce Style Website</h2>

            <p>This was the first HTML+CSS excersice I did without <strong>major</strong> guidance. Of course there were rookie mistakes that had me banging my head against the keyboard, but my nice teachers never lost their patience with me. Or they did, but they didn't show it </p>

            <p>What I love the most about this design is how compact and straighforward it is. It's perfect for those who are ready to have a little more than a social media website, but have the feeling of <em>"What do I put on a website, anyway?"</em></p>

            <p>Well, you do something like this: Answer all the Wh questions and let everyone on the web come and find you!</p>
