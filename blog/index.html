    <h3>Girl Gone Online</h3>
    <p>Would you believe me if I told you I spent almost a year practically off of social networks?
</p>
<p>
It got out of Instagram (after downloading a zip I still have to curate, two years later), Twitter, LinkedIn, and G+, which I never quite got, anyway.</p>
<p>
I had more than one Facebook account, but after a particularly uncomfortable situation, I closed them.</p>
<p>
And maybe it is cheating, but I only kept Pinterest. I did a lot of baking and sewing, if you must know. The thing is, I don't see it as a social network. What's your stance on this, I wonder? <a><a href="mailto:beemtz@thebeeletter.com">Drop me a line</a> and let me know.</p>
<p>
Of course, the last one I left was the first one I crawled back to. Since everybody is on Facebook, I like it for its messenger service, sometimes a Facebook page is the only <em>official website</em> for local businesses, and the ability to easily connect with various web services without sharing too much information and using a single login is remarkable. Especially if you forget passwords half the time.</p>
<p>
TBH, there is a lot of unfollow going there. It is, however, my daily favorite website compendium. Plus, I have just rediscovered groups, and it is cool when you find an actually pro-positive one.  I even started my own! How do you use Facebook?</p>
<p>
  Now, Twitter... What happened to it? I am in love. It is so supportive. And witty. And funny. And resourceful. I can, in all honesty, tell you it is my favorite social network now. I can be weirder than on Facebook and the reach is broader. Maybe it's just the gifs, maybe Twitter didn't change, but I did... Anyway, <a href="http://twitter.com/itsbeemtz">follow me!</a></p>
<p>
LinkedIn is an untapped resource for me. I am still navigating it, but I have a good feeling about it. Even with a newly done profile and few contacts, I have actually received interview offers there and managed to bring some traffic to this little website!</p>
<p>
Lastly, I have thinking of rejoining Instagram, just to add to the potential brand I might become. Wishful thinking. I'm sure it would end up being pictures of my pets.</p>
<p>
I digress. This post was supposed to be about how now I live online.</p>
<p>
I have been unemployed before, but this time I did it because I also needed to move. So I started a Front End Developer course online. It's the root of this website and it's also where I have gotten the tips to improve my LinkedIn profile and just general encouragement.</p>
<p>
The content I study is online, most of the tools I use are digital, I send e-mails to my teachers and have videoconferences with them with a certain frequency, there are Google Groups where everyone can ask and answer questions or just collaborate. Plus, we have our own set of Twitter hashtags, which allows me to connect with people sharing my current interests and passions.</p>
<p>
Studying online is certainly not lonely.</p>
<p>
The most awesome part is that last month I found about an online internship and I decided to take a leap of faith and applied to it via email. I had an interview via Hangouts and a few days later I was offered the position. And because meta-life is meta, it is focused on Online Communications. I am really excited that I will get to practice what I am learning and add extra skills on the way, without having to worry about commuting or gas or leaving my pets or changing my pj's.</p>
<p>
Lastly, I even follow a regular exercise program. I'm not super strong, but I'm stronger that I ever was. I'm working out three to five times a week, for the first time in twenty years. And it's online! It's cheaper, effective, less shameful, and equally painful.</p>
<p>
Yeah, after moving, my vital space is now reduced. My offline life is pets and paperwork and light housekeeping. Yet, overall, I feel constantly <span>#blessed</span>. I'm not yet living my best life, but I am getting closer to it every day: with every skill I learn, with every good willing person I connect to, and with every new project I take on.</p>
<p>
